        This page is for the cemetery listing. That away the person can pick the one they want to look at. It maybe best to find a way to show where they are . Maybe a full map view with a side bar of all the cemetery listing. From there if they select the one from the map or the side buttons, they will be taken to the right page.
        
        Until I get this done, I'm not adding this page to the test layout.
