        Please put any idea, problem, etc within here. Only write between the /* * /

       
        NOTE:

        There needs to be a new name for the Share tab. The share tab maybe a good area to show off the social sites of the area.

        Maybe this could just be a city app and not just on history (then city clubs, info, etc could be added and users will have a reason to come to the app)




        IDEA:
        In the game section, there could be a random set of Q&A for the person to answer. (Does Win App Store have rewards?)

        Something that comes up each day and tell the user a random fact about the area

        Maybe something on travel

        On the home page, the user should get weather info if they are on the net. 
        
        Is it possible to do a virtual tour of some of the places

        Need to add a splashscreen the at says some functions require net
        
        Problem:

        How to get the user to keep and user this app?     A: Maybe make this an app for the city so more can be done with it?
        
        Is there a easy way to link the app up to something to show off new events for the city? 

        Need to find a good layout for the cememetery page. This page will have a complete listing of all the cemeteries.
